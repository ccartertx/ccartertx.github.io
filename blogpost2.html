<h1>Blog Post: Week One</h1>

<h3>January 15, 2014</h3>

	<p><strong>Day 1:</strong>Aside from my 4 year old operating system not wanting to play nicely with git, Day 1 went pretty well. I got an introduction to HTML in classes in college in the early 2000s. While some new tags have emerged in recent years, the theory behind the structure and many of the tags has stayed the same. And my day job requires a lot of updating of HTML templates, so I'm comfortable working in that type of code structure.</p>
	<p>The command line (Terminal) interface was new to me. I briefly learned some command line prompts for Windows many, many years ago, but usually to accomplish some specific and rare task; it was not an everyday use kind of thing.</p>

	<p><strong>Day 2:</strong>CSS terrifies me. I've tried on a few occasions to take online courses and figure it out, but it still eludes me. Part of the challenge for me is going from a "blank page" to a styled one. I have difficulty drawing and visualizing design. I can organize information abstractly, but visual design is a constant challenge. The concepts are starting to take hold, but I still find myself struggling to remember the syntax and looking for visual inspiration from other websites.</p>
