This will be my second blog in less than a year. I started a <a href="http://tinyhousefarmstead.com" target="_blank">WordPress blog</a> in May 2013 to start documenting adventures in homebrewing and cooking (and whatever else came along, like <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/95875907@N04/" target="_blank">photography</a>).

I joined MakerSquare to challenge myself and learn new skills that I could apply at work--developing online courses--and also to help me grow this side project of brewing and blogging.

This blog will detail my journey at MakerSquare and be a place to test out new knowledge and talk about the process.
