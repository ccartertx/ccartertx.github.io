Oh, yes, there absolutely will be a margarita made in my mouth. A Colombian cartel that WON'T kidnap and kill you. Even though so many people in this office are begging for it. The worst that could happen is that I could spill coffee all over this $3,000 suit. COME ON. Mister gay is bleeding! Mister gay! He also said some things African American-y wasn't ready to hear. Yeah, like I'm going to take a whiz through this $5,000 suit. COME ON.

And don't make the water too hot. The scabs come right off. Caw ca caw, caw ca caw, caw ca caw, caw ca caw. Everybody dance NOW. Steve Holt? The moron jock?

I shall hide behind the couch. (Guy's a pro.) You're blowing my mind, Frank. You're losing blood, aren't you? Gob: Probably, my socks are wet. I made a huge tiny mistake.

The CIA should've just Googled for his hideout, evidently. ♪♪ It's The Final Countdown ♪♪ Great, now I'm gonna smell to high heaven like a tuna melt! Also, your knee is on my heart. Annyong.
