<h1>Blog Post: An Introduction</h1>

<h3>January 13, 2014</h3>

<p>This will be my second blog in less than a year. I started a <a href="http://tinyhousefarmstead.com" target="_blank">WordPress blog</a> in May 2013 to start documenting efforts in homebrewing and cooking (and whatever else came along, like <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/95875907@N04/" target="_blank">photography</a>).</p>
<p>I joined MakerSquare to challenge myself and learn new skills that I could apply at work, developing online courses, but also to help me grow this side project of brewing and blogging.</p>
<p>This blog will detail my journey at MakerSquare and also be a place to test out new knowledge and talk about the process.</p>
